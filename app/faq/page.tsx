          q: "What is DealDirect?",
          a: "DealDirect is a commission-free real estate platform that connects buyers and sellers directly. Instead of paying 5-7% agent commissions, you pay only R2,000 when your transaction completes."

        {
          q: "Which countries does DealDirect operate in?",
          a: "We currently operate in South Africa and Namibia. We're planning to expand to other African countries soon."
        },
        {
          q: "Is DealDirect really free to use?",
          a: "Yes! It's completely free to browse properties, list properties, and communicate with other users. You only pay a R2,000 success fee when your transaction completes."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "How do I contact sellers?",
          a: "Once you create a free account, you can message sellers directly through our platform. Their contact information is also displayed on property listings."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I view properties before buying?",
          a: "Yes! You arrange viewings directly with the seller. Many sellers also provide virtual tours and detailed photos."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need a lawyer to buy property?",
          a: "Yes, property transfers require legal documentation. You can choose from our verified conveyancing lawyers who offer transparent flat-rate pricing."
        },
        {
          q: "When do I pay the R1,000 buyer fee?",
          a: "You only pay when the property transfer is registered and the transaction is complete. No upfront payments required."

      category: "For Sellers",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How many properties can I list?",
          a: "You can list as many properties as you want, completely free. There are no listing fees or limits."
        },
        {
          q: "How long do listings stay active?",
          a: "Your listings stay active until you sell or manually remove them. Unlike traditional agents, there are no time limits."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I upload photos and videos?",
          a: "Yes! You can upload unlimited photos and include links to virtual tours or video walkthroughs."
        },
        {
          q: "What if I already have an agent?",
          a: "Check your agreement with your agent. If you're not under an exclusive mandate, you can list on DealDirect as well."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I handle offers and negotiations?",
          a: "You communicate directly with buyers through our messaging system or your provided contact details. You have full control over negotiations."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is it safe to buy/sell without an agent?",
          a: "Yes! The legal process remains the same - you still use a qualified conveyancing attorney to handle all legal aspects and ensure a secure transfer."
        },
        {
          q: "How are lawyers verified?",
          a: "All lawyers on our platform must provide valid practicing certificates and professional indemnity insurance. We verify their credentials before approval."
        },
        {
          q: "What about property inspections?",
          a: "We recommend buyers arrange professional inspections. This is the same process whether you use an agent or not."
        },
        {
          q: "How is payment handled?",
          a: "Property payments are handled by the conveyancing attorney through trust accounts, exactly as with traditional sales. DealDirect never handles property funds."

      category: "Fees & Payments",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "What exactly is the R2,000 fee?",
          a: "It's R1,000 for the buyer and R1,000 for the seller, paid only when the transaction successfully completes. This covers platform usage and support."
        },
        {
          q: "Are there any other fees?",
          a: "No hidden fees from DealDirect. You'll still pay normal conveyancing fees to your chosen lawyer and any government transfer duties."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I pay the success fee?",
          a: "The fee is collected when the property transfer is registered. Payment details are provided during the transaction process."
        },
        {
          q: "What if the sale falls through?",
          a: "You pay nothing. The success fee is only charged when the property transfer is successfully registered."
